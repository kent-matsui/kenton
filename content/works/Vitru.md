VITRU is sophisticated sans serif used golden ratio.

Nearly all its characters have been produced with metrics comprising 100×162 squares based on golden ratio.
It’s combined humanist sans serif’s classical form with geometric sans serif's elegant, modern and geometric form and has 3 weights to control a worldview.
So, it's suitable for both display and body text. Additionally, designers can use freely it.
