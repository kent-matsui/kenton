All my works are part of the process of exploring beauty.
The beauty of which I think - and my lifelong theme - is out of my league.
Always just out of reach.
Therefore, I can't help finding it attractive.
I'll continue expressing my interpretations incorporating everything, including sublime ideas and academic grounds while facing with my lifelong theme.

I have been very particular about beauty since I was a child, and back in junior high I used to explore beauty of my swing on the baseball team.
In this way, my exploring beauty is meant not only my works but also human movement and other all of what you can see.
